## Age and Gender Detection from scratch
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementation for detecting age and gender from facial images, built from scratch.
- CNN Architecture: Implemented using Convolutional Neural Networks combined with MaxPooling layers.
- Libraries: **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, **OpenCV**, **Matplotlib**, **NumPy**, **pandas**, and **scikit-learn**
- Dataset: [UTKFace](https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/)
- Activation Function: **ReLU**
- Optimizers: **Adam** for Age Regression and **Sigmoid** for Gender Classification
- Loss Function: Mean Squared Error(**MSE**)
- Metric: Mean Absolute Error(**MAE**)
- Accuracy: Achieved an overall accuracy of 89% on the test dataset.
- Results:
